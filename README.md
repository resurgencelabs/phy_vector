# phy_vector
The Noir repository for dealing with coordinates and multidimensional proofs using Physical Vectors by Resurgence Labs. Built on top of the Fraction data type by Resurgence Labs. Not to be confused with the Vector data structure (similar to Array).

Note: This is a highly dynamic repository. The code will change as more features are added, both at the repository level by Resurgence Labs, as well as at the language level itself by the Noit team.
